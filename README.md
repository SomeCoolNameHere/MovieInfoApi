Estimate report: 
The first estimate after I read the task was 16 hours. It's the maximum value I should invest in this task. The most important reason was that I needed to remember how to work with Mongo. 
The whole task took less than 1.5 working days because of some experiments with different possibilities to implement extendable flexible, 
and simple API key authorization and some time invested into raising the Mongo server locally.
